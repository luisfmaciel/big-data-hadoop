For\\r\\nyears he had never seen the sun. He perceived it not even now, his\\r\\neyes closed and gazing inwards on his soul, and with no feeling for\\r\\nperishable nature, fated to damnation, save contempt. For a long time\\r\\nin his hours of devout thought he had dreamt of some hermit’s desert,\\r\\nof some mountain hole, where no living thing--neither being, plant,\\r\\nnor water--should distract him from the contemplation of God. It was an\\r\\nimpulse springing from the purest love, from a loathing of all physical\\r\\nsensation. There, dying to self, and with his back turned to the light\\r\\nof day, he would have waited till he should cease to be, till nothing\\r\\nshould remain of him but the sovereign whiteness of the soul. To him\\r\\nheaven seemed all white, with a luminous whiteness as if lilies there\\r\\nsnowed down upon one, as if every form of purity, innocence, and\\r\\nchastity there blazed. But his confessor reproved him whenever he\\r\\nrelated his longings for solitude, his cravings for an existence of\\r\\nGodlike purity; and recalled him to the struggles of the Church, the\\r\\nnecessary duties of the priesthood. Later on, after his ordination, the\\r\\nyoung priest had come to Les Artaud at his own request, there hoping to\\r\\nrealise his dream of human annihilation. In that desolate spot, on that\\r\\nbarren soil, he might shut his ears to all worldly sounds, and live the\\r\\ndreamy life of a saint. For some months past, in truth, his existence\\r\\nhad been wholly undisturbed, rarely had any thrill of the village-life\\r\\ndisturbed him; and even the sun’s heat scarcely brought him any glow\\r\\nof feeling as he walked the paths, his whole being wrapped in heaven,\\r\\nheedless of the unceasing travail of life amidst which he moved.'),\n",

Not a flower that bloomed the same: the roses differed in the fashion of their wooing. Some, shy and blushing, would show but a glimpse of bud, while others, panting and wide open, seemed consumed with infatuation for their persons. There were pert, gay little things that filed off, cockade in cap; there were huge ones, bursting with sensuous charms, like portly, fattened-up sultanas; there were impudent hussies, too, in coquettish disarray, on whose petals the white traces of the powder-puff could be espied; there were virtuous maids who had donned low-necked garb like demure _bourgeoises_; and aristocratic ladies, graceful and original, who contrived attractive deshabilles. And the cup-like roses offered their perfume as in precious crystal; the drooping, urn-shaped roses let it drip drop by drop; the round, cabbage-like roses exhaled it with the even breath of slumbering flowers; while the budding roses tightly locked their petals and only sent forth as yet the faint sigh of maidenhood.', language='They were wholly one another’s now, clasped in each other’s arms!

Around them bloomed the\\r\\nroses with a mad, amorous blossoming, full of crimson and rosy and white\\r\\nlaughter. The living, opening flowers seemed to bare their very bosoms.\\r\\nYellow roses were there showing the golden skin of barbarian maidens:\\r\\nstraw-coloured roses, lemon-coloured roses, sun-coloured roses--every\\r\\nshade of the necks which are ambered by glowing skies. Then there was\\r\\nskin of softer hue: among the tea roses, bewitchingly moist and cool,\\r\\none caught glimpses of modest, bashful charms, with skin as fine as silk\\r\\ntinged faintly with a blue network of veins. Farther on all the smiling\\r\\nlife of the rose expanded: there was the blush white rose, barely\\r\\ntinged with a dash of carmine, snowy as the foot of a maid dabbling in a\\r\\nspring; there was the silvery pink, more subdued than even the glow\\r\\nwith which a youthful arm irradiates a wide sleeve; there was the clear,\\r\\nfresh rose, in which blood seemed to gleam under satin as in the bare\\r\\nshoulders of a woman bathed in light; and there was the bright pink rose\\r\\nwith its buds like the nipples of virgin bosoms, and its opening flowers\\r\\nthat suggested parted lips, exhaling warm and perfumed breath. And\\r\\nthe climbing roses, the tall cluster roses with their showers of white\\r\\nflowers, clothed all these others with the lacework of their bunches,\\r\\nthe innocence of their flimsy muslin; while, here and there, roses dark\\r\\nas the lees of wine, sanguineous, almost black, showed amidst the bridal\\r\\npurity like passion’s wounds. Verily, it was like a bridal--the bridal\\r\\nof the fragrant wood, the virginity of May led to the fertility of\\r\\nJuly and August; the first unknowing kiss culled like a nosegay on\\r\\nthe wedding morn. Even in the grass, moss roses, clad in close-fitting\\r\\ngarments of green wool, seemed to be awaiting the advent of love.\\r\\nFlowers rambled all along the sun-streaked path, faces peeped out\\r\\neverywhere to court the passing breezes.
